IFTTT was the first online Automation platform I used and was fancied by it's services. IFTTT, after their free services became limited, I was looking for a new automation service which can help me automate creation of blog posts on Tumblr and Wordpress. Then, I came across Integromat( now called Make.com ) and it seems to have something which IFTTT doesn't have. Here I am sharing a use case of creating a blog post on Wordpress easily using Telegram.

Prerequisites - 
1) A telegram channel
2) A bot id created and added as administrator of the telegram channel
3) A self hosted wordpress blog with [integromat](https://wordpress.org/plugins/integromat-connector/) connector plugin installed 

Create a bot in Telegram

And add it a ss administrator to the Telegram channel
