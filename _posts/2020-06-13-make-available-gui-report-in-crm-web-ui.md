I have a GUI report (standard or z-report) and want it to be available in WebUI. <br/>

###### STEP 1: Create T-code <br/>

T-code has to be created for the report. In the tcode setup(SE93) enable SAP GUI for HTML.

After the completion of the wizard setup verify that the transaction launcher setup is available under the Copy/Delete launch transactions

###### STEP 4: Workcenter Group setup <br/>
Identity where the links have to be made available in CRM web UI.
For example I want the links to be added in the below 2 places- in menu and under search section,
![img22](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img22.jpg)

The workcenter ID for Accounts & Products is SRV-MD.
![img23](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img23.jpg)

The workcenter further contains different WorkCenter Link Groups and we need to add the logical link to one of the relevant workcenter link group.
MD-BP-SR is the workcenter link group for Business Partner Search, so we have to use that to bring the link under search section
![img24](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img24.jpg)

Insert the logic link to the work center link group id
![img25](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img25.jpg)

###### STEP 5: Navigation Bar Profile Setup for business roles <br/>
Identify the business roles for which the links of the report have to be shown.
![img26](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img26.jpg)

Find the Navigation Bar profile linked to these business role to perform the Navigation Bar Profile Setup
For ex : Y_BR_DA_MAIN-CRM - Data Maintainer
![img27](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img27.jpg)
![img28](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img28.jpg)

Make available the link in the Navigation Bar Profile setup linked to the Business Role
![img29](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img29.jpg)

After which the link will be available under the Accounts & Products menu, 
![img30](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img30.jpg)
And also under work center area
![img31](https://a6unraj.com/sap/assets/images/img31.jpg)
Clicking the link will open the report in the web UI frame
