Apple watch SE is my first smart watch. I bought it specifically for the purpose of using it as an activity tracker(mainly for STRAVA) but after exploring it I find many other userful features that makes it unique among other smart watches
<br/>
  <ul>
    <li>
The GPS + LTE version allows to download an E-SIM into the watch and makes it work indenpendantly for making calls/SMS and use internet for the apps. This means you can receive or make calls and use the internet for the apps in the watch even when your iPhone is switched off.
    </li>
    <li>
The walkie-talkie feature makes it easy to make short conversations without needing to make a call.
    </li>
    <li>
Apple pay can be setup in watch which allows NFC payments without iPhone. It works even without a network.
    </li>
    <li>
Because of the availability of the dictation mode the UI is minimal and clean.

    </li>
    <li>
Microsoft Translator - Makes it quick and easy to dictate and translate with just few clicks.
      </li>
    <li>
Dictionary.com - App allows to quickly search synonyms by dictating the words.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>

      </li>
        <li>
