Today I was in search of free webhosting service providers

Since [000Webhost](http://000webhost.com) no longer support ad-free hosting(adds a ad banner at the bottom right corner of the web pages). Then I came accross AWS(Amazon Web Services) and Google Cloud Platform.

Initially I tried to host it using [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting/), AWS is free if your site qualifies the FreeTier. But after all setup I needed a credit card to verify my identity, so the service setup was not successful since I do not have a credit card.

Alternatively I started checking [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/web-hosting), where after the signup you will be given 300$ credits to use if for an year after verifying your billing method(credit card/debit card). If the credits are used withing the trial period or if the trial period(12 months) expires you need to opt for an upgrade to keep the service running.

I just tried a sample setup and the site setup was successful :)
